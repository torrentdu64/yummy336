Ladies who work from The Pelican Club come from all walks of life. They range in age from 18 to 50, are all shapes and sizes and many nationalities. They are all lovely people who have between 1-5 days or nights per week available to work.



Some of the existing ladies have never worked in the industry and there are some who have worked in other parlours, but prefer to work from The Pelican Club. They love the friendly atmosphere and the experienced manageressâ€™s who look after them. They also benefit from the busy shifts that enable them to earn the money they need.



The majority of ladies enjoy working from The Pelican Club premises and some enjoy becoming an Auckland Escort and specialising in outcalls.



There are mothers who have previously struggled to support their children who now find themselves living in nice houses, free of debt, taking holidays and being able to spend more time with their children. There are students who earn enough from one day or night per week to finance their studies. Some ladies work full time in other industries but need extra money to cover the bills. Many women work several times per week at The Pelican Club and some only work once or twice per week. Whatever your circumstances you can pick the days or nights that suit your situation. Open 365 days a year.



Many women worry about what they look like, what to wear, how to apply their makeup or think they may not be good enough to work. PLEASE let us be the judge of that. We will help you with everything including your clothes, hair and makeup.



This is a chance to work in stylish surrounding with lovely people, work hours to suit you and earn great money while you are enjoying yourself. Just pick up the phone and have a chat with Lyn. She will answer any questions you may have and arrange an interview for you at your convenience.



No experience is necessary. We offer full training and ongoing care. Don't be scared we pride ourselves on being the friendliest place in town. We will look after you and make sure your transition into this exciting industry is a smooth and happy one!!!
